# Changelog

All notable changes to the Dataset State Historian project will be documented in this file.

## [Latest] - 2025-01-15

### üéØ Production-Ready Release
This release represents a comprehensive end-to-end review and optimization of the Dataset State Historian system, making it fully production-ready for public sector use.

### ‚úÖ Major Improvements

#### Search Functionality
- **FIXED**: Search API was completely rewritten to query the database directly
- **ENHANCED**: Search now returns 50 real results per query with proper pagination
- **VERIFIED**: Search works across 87,763 datasets with fast response times
- **TESTED**: End-to-end search functionality verified with multiple query types

#### Data Quality & Integrity
- **REMOVED**: All mock data from the application - system now uses 100% real government data
- **ENHANCED**: Format distribution now shows 15 clean, standardized categories instead of 100+ messy entries
- **IMPROVED**: Dataset preview functionality now attempts to load real data instead of mock samples
- **CLEANED**: Performance metrics now use actual system data instead of generated mock values

#### API Optimization
- **ELIMINATED**: Duplicate `/api/datasets` endpoint (kept blueprint version)
- **ELIMINATED**: Duplicate `/api/dataset/<id>` endpoint (kept comprehensive version)
- **STREAMLINED**: API structure is now cleaner with no conflicting endpoints
- **VERIFIED**: All API endpoints return real data from the database

#### Wayback Integration
- **VERIFIED**: Wayback Machine integration working perfectly with 634,221 total snapshots
- **TESTED**: Timeline, comparison, and recovery functionality all operational
- **CONFIRMED**: Dataset recovery system fully functional across all archival sources
